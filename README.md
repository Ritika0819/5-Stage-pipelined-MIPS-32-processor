# 5-Stage-pipelined-MIPS-32-processor
Developed and tested a 5-stage pipelined MIPS-32 processor in Verilog, which supports arithmetic, logical, branch, memory operations, and halt instructions. Implemented a two-phase clock system for instruction fetching and data manipulation.
Verified using custom testbenches with realistic data, validating register and memory updates at each clock cycle. Demonstrated the functionality of load/store instructions and branch handling.
